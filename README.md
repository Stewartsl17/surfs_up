# Surfs_up Challenge 

# Overview of the Analysis

We are looking to move to Hawaii and create a Surf 'n Shake shop. After getting together our original business plan, we plan to present it to W. Avy, a surfing enthusiast, who has agreed to hear us out and potientially invest in our business. After our first successful meeting, his main question was about the weather. Based on his previous investments in the surfing industry, he had a business go out of business due to not looking into the impact of weather on the business' success. As part of our initial [analysis](https://github.com/Stewartsl17/surfs_up/blob/master/climate_analysis.ipynb), we looked into the precipitation for the past year, as well as, the other summary statistics (max, min, and avg). In addition to the initial analysis, he has asked to look specifically at temperature data in June and December 
# Results
