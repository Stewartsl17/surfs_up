# Surfs_up Challenge 

# Overview of the Analysis

We are looking to move to Hawaii and create a Surf 'n Shake shop. After getting together our original business plan, we plan to present it to W. Avy, a surfing enthusiast, who has agreed to hear us out and potentially invest in our business. After our first successful meeting, his main question was about the weather. Based on his previous investments in the surfing industry, he had a business go out of business due to not looking into the impact of weather on the business' success. As part of our initial [analysis](https://github.com/Stewartsl17/surfs_up/blob/master/climate_analysis.ipynb), we looked into the precipitation for the past year, as well as, the other summary statistics (max, min, and avg). In addition to the initial analysis, he has asked to look specifically at temperature data in June and December 

# Results 

Based on the analysis that we performed for weather in June and December, we have the following summary statistics for June and December: 

Table 1: Summary Statistics for June <br>

Table 2: Summary Statistics for December <br>

From the two sets of summary statistics, we can see a couple differences between the two months. The average (mean) temperature in December is about 71 degrees. On the other hand, the average temp in June is about 74 degrees. There is a difference of about 3-4 degrees (depending on rounding). This helps to add to the idea that the weather in Hawaii is fairly steady. The next difference between the two months is the minimum temperature in December vs June. In December, the minimum temperature is 56 degrees. In June, the minimum temperature is 64 degrees, making the difference between the two about 8 degrees. This also lends to the idea that there is a steadiness in temperature in Hawaii. The final difference that we can see is the overall count of data points between the two months: June (1700) and December (1517). This leaves a couple questions to be answered: Why are there so many points with no data between the two? What effects can this have on the data especially when comparing the two? 

# Summary 

Based on the above results and analysis, we have seen three difference between the two months: 

Average Temperature: June - 74 degrees vs. December - 71 degrees (3 degree difference) <br>
Minimum Temperature: June - 64 degrees vs. December - 56 degrees (8 degree difference) <br>
Total Data Points: June - 1700 data points vs. December - 1517 data points <br>

There are a couple of additional queriers that we could do in order to bolster our analysis. The first one would be to analyze precipitation data between the two months to see any differences that add to the weather analysis we did before. We could also look at weather again longitude and latitude which could provide some insight as to where the best places for setting up shop could be given our knowledge about the weather.
